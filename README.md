## My Phonebook Application using Python and GUI Tkinter
The application was created based on the details of assignment one. Although assignment one did not detail the actual algorithm rather it explained how to create it, the information explained what was expected of this phonebook or contact book application. 
The following will detail the steps taken to create the application using Tkinter
### Step 1
A choice was made to which algorithm would work for a phonebook. Once this was established, research was done to create a code that would best be suitable for the phonebook application.
As instructed that the application required a graphic user interface, Tkinter is used to build user interface for Python development. As a beginner programmer, this was most challenging task and at times frustrating as this was not listed in the textbook. Time was waisted in searching for a user interface instead of writing the code. 
### Step 2
 The programme had to be written and submitted in Codio under the supplied link for the assignment. To do this, a Python programme with the Tkinter application had to be linked to Codio to activate the graphic user interface to build the phonebook. The are various ways to get Tinkter running this included installing a Starter Pack Clean, Starter Pack Widget or Stack. All these application became overwhelmingly confusing.
The first challenges found with was the inability to link the “viewer” option bar in order to show the output once after writing the code and before completing the app on Tkinter.

### Step 3
Once it was established that output would not be possible from Codio, a download of the Python programme was required with the Tkinter extension. Upon downloading, more research had to be conducted about the use of Python programming with Tkinter.
This step was dedicated to learning about the Tkiter user interface and the library. The creating of the application meant time was needed to be able to develop  
 
### Step 4
Learning Tkinter took a bit of getting used to. It did deviate from creating the actual code of the phonebook as creating a graphic user interface is creating a code on its own. The following steps where taken from various sources in order to build a functioning user interface.

#### Understanding Tkinter Imports 
To build the application, firstly one needs to know that the application has to be imported to the source-code editor in question. This allows the display of the algorithm to be displayed in widget. Various sources have different ways of displaying the first line code to display the widget for an application. 

#### Creating frames, functions, and widget tables
The part that was consuming about understanding Tkinter was research of understanding how to create and write different code to display the desired output. As previously established, the phone book is required to contain different elements and perform certain functions namely, 

1.	Creating new data (creating new contact or inserting new data)
2.	Deleting old data (data could be requested to be removed due to GDPR or termination)
3.	Updating date (ability to change surname or telephone number in the event of any changes)
4.	Searching (searching for data on the app)
5.	Selection (preference of selection either female, male or none – as requested by user)

Although it was easy to create these codes once established it is the time it took to discover each line and what it meant and what algorithm would be best to get the correct output. A lot of research into You Tube channels and other libraries was investigated to attempt this task as the textbook was not providing sufficient information to get to a stage where one feels there is enough progress to show the outcome of the project.

#### Research conducted
Bite size of information was taken into consideration before articulating the desired output into code. This included understanding how to create a table in order to import data or display data. This meant that the thinking was broken into tiny sizes of research to establish the correct code that will display the correct results. 

### Colours of the widget
Python has its RGB and Hex colour code, different sources offer different codes, this meant that only a python library could be used to support the colour selection. Colour is particulary important even at begginer stage in order to seperate the differnt frames of the widget.

In conclusion

This first attempt was a different challenge and has opportunity for one to discover different ways of different sources of information.
